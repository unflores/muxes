# Just a dumb personal setup

I like to have a specific setup for my muxes. Sometimes I have a bunch of different ones at the same time. This allows me to build them out quickly.

# Usage

Put your dev directory in `HOME` then run `mux_site <site name>` and it will set up a mux with a named pane and the pane setup that I use.
